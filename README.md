# TMDB Movie App
A small project that I've created in Kotlin using MVVM Architecture. With this app, you can explore now playing and upcoming movies and see their details.

## Used Libraries
- AndroidX - For obvious reasons
- Dagger & Hilt - For dependency injection
- Retrofit2 - For fetching now playing and upcoming movies and their details from TMDB API.
- Glide - Caching and displaying back drop and poster images of movies
